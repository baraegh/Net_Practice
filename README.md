# Net_Practice
Scope of this project is learn the basics of networking. (IP address, subnet, TCP/IP subnetting, routing, ...)

# Mandatory part
This project is about solving networking problems to make a network run.

There are 10 levels available for training. Below is an example:

For each level, a non-functioning network diagram appears.

To succeed, modify the unshaded fields until your network configuration is correct.
